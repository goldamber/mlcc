            <p>Meet Angel</p>
            <p id="pAngel">Today we welcome our new resident Angel<br />
                She was raised in captivity. However, her owners didn't treat her properly since they didn't know what kind of environment she needed. Common bottlenose dolphins can travel hundreds of kilometers a day. Angel's pool was too small for her.<br />
                Now she stays with us and seems to recover. We do our best to make her feel better. We are planning to start a release program for Angel which includes proper training.<br />

            <p id="pLuna">Today we celebrate the release of our favourite sea lion Luna<br />
                She became one of our shelter animals when she was a young adult and had to stay with us for 5 month in order to recover. Thanks to your donations her recovery didn't take long. She became great friends with our stuff members. Everybody will niss her now.<br />
                Glad to know that she has successfully joined the pack of wild sea lions which seemed to be her family. Enjoy your freedom Luna!<br />

            <p>Found a newborn orca of southern resident pod</p>
            <p id="pFirstLine">We welcome a new member of southern resident killer whale pod<br />
                Research program is one of MLCC activities. Today our researchers discovered a newborn orca calf. This is unique because southern resident killer whales are the most endangered subspecies of orca. Because of this every single member is extremely important for survival of this kind.<br />
                This is a great achievement for both scientists and killer whales!<br />

                Together with our volunteers we watched different kinds of whales, dolphins, and even seals. We build a great relationship with our team members, had lots of fun, and learnt more about marine wildlife.<br />
                Don't miss our next trip! Stay tuned and we will post the next update soon.<br />

            <p>First steps of sea turtules</p>
            <p>Today we helped newborn turtles to make their first steps<br />
                It was so exiting to watch these cute little green sea turtles run towards their home in the ocean. Also, we made a great effort to keep them safe.<br />
                Green sea turtle is one of endangered species, so it is important to ensure the survival of every single animal.<br />
